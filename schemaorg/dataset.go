// Distribution see : https://schema.org/distribution
// A downloadable form of this dataset, at a specific location, in a specific format.
Distribution *DataDownload `json:"distribution"`

// IncludedInDataCatalog see : https://schema.org/includedInDataCatalog
// A data catalog which contains this dataset. Supersedes catalog (see: https://schema.org/catalog), includedDataCatalog (see: https://schema.org/includedDataCatalog). Inverse property: dataset (see: https://schema.org/dataset).
IncludedInDataCatalog *DataCatalog `json:"includedInDataCatalog"`

// Issn see : https://schema.org/issn
// The International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) that identifies this serial publication. You can repeat this property to identify different formats of, or the linking ISSN (ISSN-L) for, this serial publication.
Issn string `json:"issn"`

// MeasurementTechnique see : https://schema.orghttp://pending.schema.org/measurementTechnique
// A technique or technology used in a Dataset (see: https://schema.org/Dataset) (or DataDownload (see: https://schema.org/DataDownload), DataCatalog (see: https://schema.org/DataCatalog)),
// corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (described using variableMeasured (see: https://schema.org/variableMeasured)). This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but rather as a high level summary for dataset discovery.
// 
// For example, if variableMeasured (see: https://schema.org/variableMeasured) is: molecule concentration, measurementTechnique (see: https://schema.org/measurementTechnique) could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence".
// 
// If the variableMeasured (see: https://schema.org/variableMeasured) is "depression rating", the measurementTechnique (see: https://schema.org/measurementTechnique) could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".
// 
// If there are several variableMeasured (see: https://schema.org/variableMeasured) properties recorded for some given data object, use a PropertyValue (see: https://schema.org/PropertyValue) for each variableMeasured (see: https://schema.org/variableMeasured) and attach the corresponding measurementTechnique (see: https://schema.org/measurementTechnique).
MeasurementTechnique interface{} `json:"measurementTechnique"` // types : Text URL

// VariableMeasured see : https://schema.orghttp://pending.schema.org/variableMeasured
// The variableMeasured property can indicate (repeated as necessary) the  variables that are measured in some dataset, either described as text or as pairs of identifier and description using PropertyValue.
