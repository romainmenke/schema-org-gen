Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the &#39;speakable&#39; property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.
	 * 
	 * The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible &#39;content-locator&#39; values:
	 * 
	 * 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.
	 * 
	 * 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector (see: https://schema.org/cssSelector) property.
	 * 
	 * 3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath (see: https://schema.org/xpath) property.
	 * 
	 * For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this
	 * we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification (see: https://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification)  which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property.
