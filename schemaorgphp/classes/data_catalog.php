	 * A technique or technology used in a Dataset (see: https://schema.org/Dataset) (or DataDownload (see: https://schema.org/DataDownload), DataCatalog (see: https://schema.org/DataCatalog)),
	 * corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (described using variableMeasured (see: https://schema.org/variableMeasured)). This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but rather as a high level summary for dataset discovery.
	 * 
	 * For example, if variableMeasured (see: https://schema.org/variableMeasured) is: molecule concentration, measurementTechnique (see: https://schema.org/measurementTechnique) could be: &quot;mass spectrometry&quot; or &quot;nmr spectroscopy&quot; or &quot;colorimetry&quot; or &quot;immunofluorescence&quot;.
	 * 
	 * If the variableMeasured (see: https://schema.org/variableMeasured) is &quot;depression rating&quot;, the measurementTechnique (see: https://schema.org/measurementTechnique) could be &quot;Zung Scale&quot; or &quot;HAM-D&quot; or &quot;Beck Depression Inventory&quot;.
	 * 
	 * If there are several variableMeasured (see: https://schema.org/variableMeasured) properties recorded for some given data object, use a PropertyValue (see: https://schema.org/PropertyValue) for each variableMeasured (see: https://schema.org/variableMeasured) and attach the corresponding measurementTechnique (see: https://schema.org/measurementTechnique).
