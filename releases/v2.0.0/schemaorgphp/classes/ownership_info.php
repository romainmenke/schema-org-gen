	/**
	 * Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described.
	 *       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	 *       Many (but not all) pages have a fairly clear primary topic, some entity or thing that the page describes. For
	 *       example a restaurant&#39;s home page might be primarily about that Restaurant, or an event listing page might
	 *       represent a single event. The mainEntity and mainEntityOfPage properties allow you to explicitly express the relationship
	 *       between the page and the primary entity.
	 *       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	 *
	 *       Related properties include sameAs, about, and url.
	 *       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	 *
	 *       The sameAs and url properties are both similar to mainEntityOfPage. The url property should be reserved to refer to more
	 *       official or authoritative web pages, such as the item’s official website. The sameAs property also relates a thing
	 *       to a page that indirectly identifies it. Whereas sameAs emphasises well known pages, the mainEntityOfPage property
	 *       serves more to clarify which of several entities is the main one for that page.
	 *       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	 *
	 *       mainEntityOfPage can be used for any page, including those not recognized as authoritative for that entity. For example,
	 *       for a product, sameAs might refer to a page on the manufacturer’s official site with specs for the product, while
	 *       mainEntityOfPage might be used on pages within various retailers’ sites giving details for the same product.
	 *       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	 *
	 *       about is similar to mainEntity, with two key differences. First, about can refer to multiple entities/topics,
	 *       while mainEntity should be used for only the primary one. Second, some pages have a primary entity that itself
	 *       describes some other entity. For example, one web page may display a news article about a particular person.
	 *       Another page may display a product review for a particular product. In these cases, mainEntity for the pages
	 *       should refer to the news article or review, respectively, while about would more properly refer to the person or product.
