	// AdditionalType see : https://schema.org/additionalType
	// An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the &#39;typeof&#39; attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
	// types : URL
	AdditionalType []string `json:"additionalType,omitempty"`

	// AlternateName see : https://schema.org/alternateName
	// An alias for the item.

	AlternateName []string `json:"alternateName,omitempty"`

	// Box see : https://schema.org/box
	// A box is the area enclosed by the rectangle formed by two points. The first point is the lower corner, the second point is the upper corner. A box is expressed as two points separated by a space character.
	// types : Text
	Box []string `json:"box,omitempty"`

	// Circle see : https://schema.org/circle
	// A circle is the circular region of a specified radius centered at a specified latitude and longitude. A circle is expressed as a pair followed by a radius in meters.

	// Description see : https://schema.org/description
	// A short description of the item.

	// Elevation see : https://schema.org/elevation
	// The elevation of a location.
	// types : Number Text
	Elevation []interface{} `json:"elevation,omitempty"`

	// Image see : https://schema.org/image
	// An image of the item. This can be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://schema.org/URL&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; or a fully described &lt;a href=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;ImageObject&lt;/a&gt;.
	// types : URL ImageObject
	Image []interface{} `json:"image,omitempty"`

	// Line see : https://schema.org/line
	// A line is a point-to-point path consisting of two or more points. A line is expressed as a series of two or more point objects separated by space.
	// types : Text
	Line []string `json:"line,omitempty"`

	// MainEntityOfPage see : https://schema.org/mainEntityOfPage
	// Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described.
	//       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	//       Many (but not all) pages have a fairly clear primary topic, some entity or thing that the page describes. For
	//       example a restaurant&#39;s home page might be primarily about that Restaurant, or an event listing page might
	//       represent a single event. The mainEntity and mainEntityOfPage properties allow you to explicitly express the relationship
	//       between the page and the primary entity.
	//       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	//
	//       Related properties include sameAs, about, and url.
	//       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	//
	//       The sameAs and url properties are both similar to mainEntityOfPage. The url property should be reserved to refer to more
	//       official or authoritative web pages, such as the item’s official website. The sameAs property also relates a thing
	//       to a page that indirectly identifies it. Whereas sameAs emphasises well known pages, the mainEntityOfPage property
	//       serves more to clarify which of several entities is the main one for that page.
	//       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	//
	//       mainEntityOfPage can be used for any page, including those not recognized as authoritative for that entity. For example,
	//       for a product, sameAs might refer to a page on the manufacturer’s official site with specs for the product, while
	//       mainEntityOfPage might be used on pages within various retailers’ sites giving details for the same product.
	//       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	//
	//       about is similar to mainEntity, with two key differences. First, about can refer to multiple entities/topics,
	//       while mainEntity should be used for only the primary one. Second, some pages have a primary entity that itself
	//       describes some other entity. For example, one web page may display a news article about a particular person.
	//       Another page may display a product review for a particular product. In these cases, mainEntity for the pages
	//       should refer to the news article or review, respectively, while about would more properly refer to the person or product.
	//
	// types : CreativeWork URL
	MainEntityOfPage []interface{} `json:"mainEntityOfPage,omitempty"`

	// Name see : https://schema.org/name
	// The name of the item.
	// types : Text
	Name []string `json:"name,omitempty"`

	// Polygon see : https://schema.org/polygon
	// A polygon is the area enclosed by a point-to-point path for which the starting and ending points are the same. A polygon is expressed as a series of four or more space delimited points where the first and final points are identical.
	// types : Text
	Polygon []string `json:"polygon,omitempty"`

	// PotentialAction see : https://schema.org/potentialAction
	// Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an &#39;object&#39; role.
	// types : Action
	PotentialAction []*Action `json:"potentialAction,omitempty"`

	// SameAs see : https://schema.org/sameAs
	// URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item&#39;s identity. E.g. the URL of the item&#39;s Wikipedia page, Freebase page, or official website.
	// types : URL
	SameAs []string `json:"sameAs,omitempty"`

	// Url see : https://schema.org/url
	// URL of the item.
	// types : URL
	Url []string `json:"url,omitempty"`
