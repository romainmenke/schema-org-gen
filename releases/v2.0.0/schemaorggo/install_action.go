	ActionStatus []*ActionStatusType `json:"actionStatus,omitempty"`

	// AdditionalType see : https://schema.org/additionalType
	// An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the &#39;typeof&#39; attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
	// types : URL
	AdditionalType []string `json:"additionalType,omitempty"`

	// Agent see : https://schema.org/agent
	// The direct performer or driver of the action (animate or inanimate). e.g. *John* wrote a book.
	// types : Organization Person
	Agent []interface{} `json:"agent,omitempty"`

	// AlternateName see : https://schema.org/alternateName
	// An alias for the item.

	// Description see : https://schema.org/description
	// A short description of the item.
	// types : Text
	Description []string `json:"description,omitempty"`

	// EndTime see : https://schema.org/endTime
	// The endTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to end. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. e.g. John wrote a book from January to *December*.
	//
	// Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions.
	// types : DateTime
	EndTime []DateTime `json:"endTime,omitempty"`

	// Error see : https://schema.org/error
	// For failed actions, more information on the cause of the failure.
	// types : Thing
	Error []*Thing `json:"error,omitempty"`

	// ExpectsAcceptanceOf see : https://schema.org/expectsAcceptanceOf
	// An Offer which must be accepted before the user can perform the Action. For example, the user may need to buy a movie before being able to watch it.
	// types : Offer
	ExpectsAcceptanceOf []*Offer `json:"expectsAcceptanceOf,omitempty"`

	// Image see : https://schema.org/image
	// An image of the item. This can be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://schema.org/URL&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; or a fully described &lt;a href=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;ImageObject&lt;/a&gt;.
	// types : URL ImageObject
	Image []interface{} `json:"image,omitempty"`

	// Instrument see : https://schema.org/instrument
	// The object that helped the agent perform the action. e.g. John wrote a book with *a pen*.
	// types : Thing
	Instrument []*Thing `json:"instrument,omitempty"`

	// Location see : https://schema.org/location
	// The location of the event, organization or action.
	// types : Place PostalAddress
	Location []interface{} `json:"location,omitempty"`

	// MainEntityOfPage see : https://schema.org/mainEntityOfPage
	// Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described.
	//       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	//       Many (but not all) pages have a fairly clear primary topic, some entity or thing that the page describes. For
	//       example a restaurant&#39;s home page might be primarily about that Restaurant, or an event listing page might
	//       represent a single event. The mainEntity and mainEntityOfPage properties allow you to explicitly express the relationship
	//       between the page and the primary entity.
	//       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	//
	//       Related properties include sameAs, about, and url.
	//       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	//
	//       The sameAs and url properties are both similar to mainEntityOfPage. The url property should be reserved to refer to more
	//       official or authoritative web pages, such as the item’s official website. The sameAs property also relates a thing
	//       to a page that indirectly identifies it. Whereas sameAs emphasises well known pages, the mainEntityOfPage property
	//       serves more to clarify which of several entities is the main one for that page.
	//       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	//
	//       mainEntityOfPage can be used for any page, including those not recognized as authoritative for that entity. For example,
	//       for a product, sameAs might refer to a page on the manufacturer’s official site with specs for the product, while
	//       mainEntityOfPage might be used on pages within various retailers’ sites giving details for the same product.
	//       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	//
	//       about is similar to mainEntity, with two key differences. First, about can refer to multiple entities/topics,
	//       while mainEntity should be used for only the primary one. Second, some pages have a primary entity that itself
	//       describes some other entity. For example, one web page may display a news article about a particular person.
	//       Another page may display a product review for a particular product. In these cases, mainEntity for the pages
	//       should refer to the news article or review, respectively, while about would more properly refer to the person or product.
	//
	// types : CreativeWork URL

	// types : Thing
	Object []*Thing `json:"object,omitempty"`

	// Participant see : https://schema.org/participant

	// Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an &#39;object&#39; role.
	// types : Action
	PotentialAction []*Action `json:"potentialAction,omitempty"`

	// Result see : https://schema.org/result
	// The result produced in the action. e.g. John wrote *a book*.
	// types : Thing
	Result []*Thing `json:"result,omitempty"`

	// SameAs see : https://schema.org/sameAs
	// URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item&#39;s identity. E.g. the URL of the item&#39;s Wikipedia page, Freebase page, or official website.
	// types : URL
	SameAs []string `json:"sameAs,omitempty"`

	// StartTime see : https://schema.org/startTime
	// The startTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to start. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. e.g. John wrote a book from *January* to December.
